The art that inspired my work was the Suprematist Composition by Ukrainian painter Kazimir Malevich in 1916. This art piece is 
based off Suprematism, an art movement that was active during Vladimir Lenin's reign, the Russian Revolution, as well as during 
the early days of the Soviet Union. The purpose of Suprematism was to express art in a "supreme and pure" form of abstract art in 
basic geometric shapes and forms such as triangles and quadrilaterals. When Joseph Stalin came to power after the death of Lenin, 
Suprematism found itself under attack with harsh criticism from the government and was therefore banned.  Since we recently 
started learning about shapes, I believed that drawing my sources from early geometric abstract art works would be an interesting 
topic for my self-portrait. However, I would concede that my work is not completely based off of Suprematist Composition due to my 
shapes not being symetrically aligned with each other. My most difficult challenge was carefully typing the numbers of the shape 
syntax. Another challenge was selecting the fill colors the program would allow me to put into the html. Originally, I wanted the 
eyes to be yellow but everytime I typed in the fill code it would only turn out to be white. Since I was unable to to revert it, I 
just decided to leave it white due to the fact that I had a blue background so they would still be visible no matter what. I also had to change all my original shapes to triangles and quadrilaterals because I had difficulties trying to create other shapes. For example, I drew my lips with just regular lines but I had trouble in creating a syntax for it when I could not add the fill color, red, to it so I decided to convert it to two triangles sticking together.
