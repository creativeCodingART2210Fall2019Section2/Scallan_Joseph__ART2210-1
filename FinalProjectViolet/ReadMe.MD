For my final project I decided to make a similar self-portrait to my first project but this time of my dog, Violet. She died of old age a two months ago. I have struggled with a great many things in this course but the one thing I understand completely is the color and the shapes. My goal was to go into more detail with this portrait using more triangles and quads.
